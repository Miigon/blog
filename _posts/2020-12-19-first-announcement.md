# What?

Here's my personal blog on which I may post stuffs like what I learned recently,
 what I found fascinating and want to talk about, or just simply some random thoughts.

# Why?

I have been learning programming for quite some time, but I havn't really done 
that much summarizing along the way.

That's why I decided to start this blog.

I want to write down everything I am learning, so that it's easy for me to pick
them up later if I happened to forget about them and need to do so. I will also post
some technical difficulties that I encountered and try to explain my thought process
and final solutions to them.

# What's the plan?

I still havn't fully figured out what I might want to post. But most likely, it would
be among these categories:
- Data structures, Algorithms
- Computer Networking
- Object-oriented Programming and Design Patterns
- Operating Systems
- New Programming Languages and Features
- Tools, Techniques and Tricks

Inspirations will most likely come from:
- My courses and appointments
- My personal projects and projects with my friends
- My own understanding of the books


I will not be covering the front-end side of thing, since that's not the path I decided to follow.
But anything can change in the future, so who knows?

I will try to keep the blog all-English in an effort to let my contents reach a broader audience,
and improve my English at the same time.

# Disclaimer

This is my personal blog, that means most of the time the articles will certainly not be
up to professional standards and may even be straight up inaccurate. The main purpose of
this blog is for me to write down my learning process, so the main target reader is still myself.

**For any consequence caused by your use of the blog content, I will not bear any**
**legal responsibilities.**

If you end up losing your job or accidentally deleting your company's database
after following my blog, well, that's your fault for believing some random guy on the
internet when doing something so crucial. ðŸ˜Š
